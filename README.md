An advisor from a large brokerage firms directs investments for the foundation of a small church.

St. Matthew is a small Lutheran Church in Appleton, Wisconsin.  In 2005, our church was blessed to receive an endowment of $1 million.  $400k of that was designated for building projects and spent quickly.  The remaining $600k was invested in securities managed by a large brokerage firm.  This paper compares the total performance of that managed portfolio to the performance of a portfolio of index funds with similar asset allocation and risk level.  The index fund approach would have performed about 2% better per year for the period in question.  It was recommended that St. Matthew change its investment approach to lower its management costs.
